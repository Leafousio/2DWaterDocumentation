# Demo Scenes

?> There is a lot of **simple demo scenes** in which you can see how the water is set up in certain game scenarios and even copy the water components.

?> The sprites, scene effects and particle systems are made by me, so, while I personally wouldn't do that, **you can use them in your projects**.

<div class = 'image'>

!> I setup sorting layers in demo scenes with a c# script, but on some versions of Unity it doesn't work. In this case you have to setup those sorting layers by hand. Preview of how they should look: 

- Reflection_Plane
- plat
- Objects
- Reflection_Plane2
- droplets
